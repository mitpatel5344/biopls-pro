    <h2 class="subtitle">Research Behind BioPls Pro</h2>
    <p>
     Dr. Eva Selhub, MD who besides being a Clinical Associate in Medicine at
     Mass General, the nation's #1 ranked hospital is also an instructor in 
     medicine at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Selhub has reveled some important facts about her research and wrote about something called Conjugated Linoleic Acid. Or CLA for short. CLA is a naturally
     occurring fatty acid that's found in beef and dairy products. Which is one
     of the main ingredients inside BioPls Slim Pro.
    </p>

    <p>
     Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA) is something the body can't produce on its own. Instead we need to take it through eating. However, most of our foods are over-processed these days so getting enough CLA from food alone is almost impossible. And that's the main behind excess fat gain according to Dr. Selhub. Therefore, Biopls pro appears that CLA blocks fat cells from growing bigger or swelling by influencing enzymes that affect fat growth. CLA also seems to increase the speed of fat burning.
