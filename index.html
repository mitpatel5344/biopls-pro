    <h2 class="subtitle">Research Behind BioPls</h2>
    <p>
     Dr. Eva Selhub, MD who besides being a Clinical Associate in Medicine at
     Mass General, the nation’s #1 ranked hospital is also an instructor in
     medicine at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Selhub was wrote about something
     called Conjugated Linoleic Acid. Or CLA for short. CLA is a naturally
     occurring fatty acid that’s found in beef and dairy products. Which is one
     of the main ingredients inside BioPls Slim Pro.
    </p>

    <p>
     Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA) is something the body can’t produce on its
     own. Instead it’s something we need to consume through eating But because
     most of our foods are over-processed these days Getting enough CLA from
     food alone can be close to impossible. And that’s a big deal Because
     according to Dr. Selhub. “It appears that CLA blocks fat cells from growing
     bigger or swelling by influencing enzymes that affect fat growth. CLA also
     seems to increase the speed of fat burning.”

    <h2 class="subtitle">How Does BioPls Pro Work?</h2>
    <p>
     BioPls Pro is an incredible weight loss formula that emplys eight different
     plant and herb extracts that together work towards increasing brown adipose
     tissue (BAT) in the body. BAT is actually a fat burning furnace and plays a
     key role in weight loss. In fact, BAT is capable of burning calories 300
     times faster than regular fat cells. By burning calories round the clock,
     it assists you in maintaining a caloric deficit diet.
    </p>
    <p>
     According to the manufacturers, BioPls weightloss is a supplement different
     than anything you've experienced before. It is the only supplement out
     there with a proprietary combination of 8 exotic nutrients and plants that
     focus on low brown adipose tissue (BAT) levels that may otherwise lead to
     unexplained weight gain. Increasing those BAT levels even in tiny amounts
     makes BioPls suppliment increase the fat burning power of the body to great
     extents. Plus, higher levels of BAT also increase the energy levels of the
     body and jumpstart your metabolism.

    <h2 class="subtitle">Ingredients of BioPls Pro</h2>
    <p>
     The efficiency of a supplement is dependent on its constituting
     ingredients. Whether it's fat reduction, more energy production, or an
     improved immunity, BioPls Pro also exhibits its positive effects due to the
     action of its ingredients that have been professionally tested and
     clinically confirmed to increase low brown adipose tissue after you consume
     the supplement. Below are its major ingredients, along with their effects
     on the body.
    </p>
    <ul class="ingredients__list">
     <li class="ingredients__list-item">
      <p>
       <b>Garcinia Cambogia</b> - The Malabar Tamarind, a tropical fruit, is
       harvested to create the Garcinia fruit, which is the source of the food
       extract. It does this by assisting in appetite suppression and reducing
       the body’s capacity to generate fat. The citrate lyase enzyme is
       inhibited by one of its active components, hydroxycitric acid. The enzyme
       citrate lyase promotes fat accumulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>Linoleic acid</b> - You may get conjugated linoleic acid from sources
       other than meat and dairy products (CLA). It supports weight reduction
       and has other health advantages. A polyunsaturated fatty acid called
       conjugated linoleic acid may be found naturally in a variety of healthful
       meals. It is also known as trans fat. Simply put, the human body is
       unable to produce this on its own.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>Coffee extract</b> - A frequent component of products promoted as
       weight reduction aids is green coffee bean extract. Unroasted coffee
       beans are used to make the extract. High levels of chlorogenic acid, an
       antioxidant with a number of health advantages, are present in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>Lactobacillus Acidophilus</b> - It is a probiotic that is commonly
       used in several food supplements. It is mainly found in fermented foods
       such as yogurts. The bacteria also naturally occur in the intestines and
       play a significant role in human health. It plays a role in the
       production of lactic acid, as the name suggests.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>Green Tea Leaf Extract</b> - Green tea is one of the most consumed
       beverages in the world. Green tea extract is a concentrated form of green
       tea. One capsule is equivalent to an average cup of green tea. It
       contains a high amount of antioxidants which helps flush out free
       radicals from the blood. It promotes heart, liver, and brain health and
       improves the skin’s health. It is known to reduce the risk of cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>Resveratrol</b> - Resveratrol is a type of natural phenol and
       phytoalexin produced by several plants. It helps in burning visceral fat
       cells that get accumulated in the body over time. The best thing about
       resveratrol is that it minimizes the levels of the most harmful form of
       cholesterol, i.e. LDL cholesterol.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>Amur Cork Bark</b> - The chief action of this ingredient is to improve
       digestion and overall gut health. It reduces bloating and fights numerous
       digestive issues that may otherwise lead to weight gain. It also
       regulates metabolism by improving heart health and the liver function.
